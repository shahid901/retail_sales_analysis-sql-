# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project
    This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, 
    clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory 
    data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. 

# Objectives
  **1. Set up a retail sales database:** Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
  
  **2. Data Cleaning:** Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
  
  **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
  
  **4. Business Analysis:** Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

# Project Structure
  **1. Database Setup:**
          -Database Creation
          -Table Creation/ Importing CSV File
          -Altering Column Name
          
  **2. Data Exploration & Cleaning:**
          -Record Count
          -Customer Count
          -Category Count
          -Null Value Check

  **3. Data Analysis & Findings:**
  
          1. Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05
          
          2. Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than or equal to 4 in the month of Nov-2022 
          
          3. Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.
          
          4. Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.
          
          5. Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.
          
          6. Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.
          
          7. Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year
          
          8. Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 
          
          9. Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.
          
          10. Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <=12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)
          
          11. Write a SQL query to compare weekday sales to weekend sales 
          
          12. Write a SQL query to calculate the total profit generated (Total Sale - COGS)
